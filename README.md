This code generates random test problems of MPEC with quadratic objective
functions and affine variational inequality constraints, and certain special
cases.

The MPEC problem is defined as:

```math
min   f(x,y)                                          
s.t.  (x,y) in Z                                      
      y in S(x), S(x) solves AVI(F(x,y), C(x))        
      F(x,y) is linear with respect to both x and y   
      C(x) is polyhedral in y-space                   
```

* x: n dimensional first level variable.
* y: m dimensional second level variable.
* P: P=[Px Pxy^T; Pxy Py] -- Hessian of the objective function.
* c, d: coefficient vectors associated with x and y, respectively.
* A, a: A is an l by (m+n) matrix, a is an l dimensional vector matrix. Used in the upper level constraints A*[x;y] + a <= 0 (models are described in paper in terms of G and H where A=[G, H])
* F, q, N, M: N is an m by n matrix, M is an m by m matrix, and q is an m by 1 vector. These define F linearly in terms of x and y: F=N*x+M*y+q.
* D, E, b: D is a p by n matrix, E is a p by m matrix, b is an m dimensional vector. Used in the lower level constraints for type 100 problems.
* u: m dimensional vector used in lower level constraints for type 200 problem.


AVI-QPEC (type 100)
--------------------

```math
min   0.5*[x;y]^T*P*[x;y] + [c;d]^T*[x;y]
s.t.  A*[x;y] + a <= 0
      D*x + E*y + b <= 0
      lambda >= 0
      (D*x + E*y + b)^T lambda = 0
      N*x + M*y + E^T*lambda + q = 0
```

BOX-MPEC (type 200)
--------------------

For this case, let y=[y1;y2]　where variables y1 have both upper and
lower bounds and y2 variables only have lower bounds.  Because there
are no other lower level constraints, the case simplifies and there
are no lambda variables.

```
min   0.5*[x;y]^T*P*[x;y] + [c;d]^T*[x;y]
s.t.  A*[x;y] + a <= 0
      0 <= y1 <= u
      0 <= y2
      N2*x + M2*y + q2 >= 0    complements    0 <= y2
      N1*x + M1*y + q1    complements    0 <= y1 <= u
```

PATRICIA'S ADDITION: SPECIAL BOX-MPEC (type 201)
-------------------------------------------------

It is convenient for us to have one more type where all second
level variables have both lower and upper bounds and all first level
variables are bounded above and below as well.

```
min   0.5*[x;y]^T*P*[x;y] + [c;d]^T*[x;y]
s.t.  A*[x;y] + a <= 0
      0 <= x <= ux
      0 <= y <= uy
      N1*x + M1*y + q1    complements    0 <= y <= uy
```

LCP-MPEC type(300)
-------------------

```
min   0.5*[x;y]^T*P*[x;y] + [c;d]^T*[x;y]
s.t.  A*[x;y] + a <= 0
      0 <= y
      N*x + M*y + q >= 0
      (N*x + M*y + q)^Ty = 0
```

GOOD-LCP (type 800)
--------------------

The objective function is equivalent to sum((x-1)^2) + sum((y+2)^2)
shifted by a constant.  It is minimized by the point closest
to (1 ... 1,-2 ... -2), which is the origin.

```        
min   x^Tx + y^Ty - 2*sum(x) + 4*sum(y)
s.t.  x <= y
      0 <= y
      (y-x)^Ty = 0
```

BAD-LCP type(900)
-------------------

This problem has multiple local minima.
The objective function is equivalent to sum((x+1)^2) + sum((y-2)^2)
shifted by a constant.  It is minimized by the feasible point closest
to (-1 ... -1, 2 ... 2), which is (-1 ... -1, 0 ... 0).

```        
min   x^Tx + y^Ty + 2*sum(x) - 4*sum(y)
s.t.  x <= y
      0 <= y
      (y-x)^Ty = 0
```
